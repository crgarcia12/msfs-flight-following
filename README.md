## What is it?
A simple app that connects to Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020) to display your aircraft, and things like its altitude, speed, autopilot settings, etc., on a map.

## How do I install it?
Download the latest version from the [releases section](https://github.com/kurt1288/msfs-flight-following/releases/). Then, just run the executable. If you want to "uninstall", just delete the folder.

## Compile it yourself
You're welcome to build the app yourself. Just download the repository. You'll need Visual Studio 2019 (Community edition is fine) and .NET Core 3.1 installed.
